<p><strong>Learn By Doing</strong></p>
<p>~or~</p>
<p><strong>The Great Big List of Software Project Ideas</strong></p>
<p><em>Projectbook</em> is a collection of over 50 software project ideas for people looking to learn a given language or technology but short on inspiration for what to build. These projects tend to vary in complexity and what they exercise.</p>
<p>My goal with this collection is to provide detailed enough specifications to get you started on project.</p>
<p>I've found that a lot of software tutorials are too simple and basic and that I only really learn through building something.</p>
<p>When learning a new programming language or library or technology, there's so much to take in that having to figure out what to build and what it should and shouldn't do can be enough friction to slow down any momentum and fun you're having.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, these projects are just me sharing software and tools that I want to build myself.</p>
<p>Often a simple todo app is the non-trivial example project that people point to. It's a fine one because it has a variety of needs and state management. But it's so boring! And overdone! So these are the ideas beyond the todo list app.</p>

<p>Please, please, please don't go into these projects thinking, &quot;Wow, this idea is going to make me rich! It's the next start-up! It's the next big thing! Get those angel investors on the line!&quot; I fall into this trap from time to time, especially when I'm dreaming big. I start thinking about monetization and hosting and the viability of something existing as a business. What you're trying to do is learn! Not start a business. Don't burden yourself with the responsibiity of doing anything other than experimenting at the beginning.</p>
<p>If you were to learn how to play guitar and you're playing simplified covers of your favorite songs, which is basically what we're doing here, would you start by thinking about how you'll record, mix, master, and release your cover album to make you rich? No! You'd practice them, play them for friends, maybe record them. Maybe one day you'd be in a cover band. Or even start writing your own original music. But don't concern yourself with anything other than learning and having fun right now.</p>
<p>When it comes to the user experience (UX) (the flow through your program) and user interface (UI) (the look of your program), look at similar programs and how they work. Your best bet is to take some time to do research and gather reference. Pay attention, take screenshots, and make note of how the apps work.</p>
<h2 id="reading-order"><a class="header" href="#reading-order">Reading Order</a></h2>
<p>The order of the chapters in each section is loosely based on my perceived difficulty of them. My judgement may be off in some cases, but I think that's a pretty good bet.</p>
<p><a href="./command-line-interfaces/_introduction.html">Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)</a> are first because I think they're generally a nice place to start because they don't require graphic rendering and a GUI. This makes their interfaces quite a bit simpler since there are only so many forms of input and output.</p>
<p>Some types of projects won't make sense for certain technologies. If you want to learn HTML, then ideas for CLIs won't be much help for you. Check out <a href="./websites/_introduction.html">Websites</a> instead.</p>
<p>However, don't read this book as you would a normal linear book. It's instead meant to be a place to browse around, experiment, find inspiration, and start hacking away and learning.</p>
<h2 id="wireframes--design-assets"><a class="header" href="#wireframes--design-assets">Wireframes &amp; Design Assets</a></h2>
<p>For projects with a GUI, it can be daunting to think about what it will look like and even potential assets.</p>
<p>Not a designer? That's totally okay!</p>
<p>Throughout the projects, you'll find wireframes, specs, and assets. You're welcome to use them or disregard them. Whatever you want. It's your project! Your learning. I'm just trying to help.</p>
<p>The nice thing about building GUI apps is that there are lots of graphical libraries and toolkits that you can utilize without designing or coding them from scratch, from things like GTK to Apple's platforms' various libraries to Material Design to Bootstrap. </p>
<p>Don't worry too much about it looking generic or boring when you're learning, unless what you're learning is how to polish a GUI! It really depends on what you want to get out of your project. Whether you use libraries or existing code or do it all from scratch.</p>

<p>I am Brett! Nice to meet you. Thanks for checking this out. I'm a software programmer who has been doing some form of coding since I was 13. Professionally, I build web applications and APIs with Ruby, Rails, TypeScript, GraphQL, and web components. Personally, I dabble with all sorts of programming, from CLIs to game dev. I like checking out new languages and frameworks on the regular.</p>
<p>Since I'm not, let's say, a software programmer for smart refridgerators, there aren't a ton of ideas related to smart refridgerators. The focus is more on the software I use regularly or have to build. This is great because I understand the needs and functionality, which means I don't have to think too much about why something needs to do something and can instead focus on learning the technology.</p>
<p>I'd love to have more project ideas for different types of programming, like network programming and embedded hardware and such. Hopefully in the future!</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="command-line-interfaces"><a class="header" href="#command-line-interfaces">Command Line Interfaces</a></h1>
<p>Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) are programs run from the terminal or command prompt. They're extremely broad in scope, as they can be used for any sort of computing—from starting a server to interacting with files.</p>
<p>Building a command line interface is great for learning a new language because you don't have to worry about the graphical interface and visual design. You can instead focus on the interactions and the work the program does. This simplifies things quite a bit. It also lets you learn the language's standard library, as most make writing CLIs quite easy.</p>
<p>If you use a lot of command line apps, then I imagine you'll be drawn to coding your own. It's a lot of fun. And no matter how simple the program is, all that matters is that it's useful. The Unix philosophy of small programs that can be chained together is really great for learning and building tools and commands.</p>
<h2 id="mindset--targets"><a class="header" href="#mindset--targets">Mindset / Targets</a></h2>
<p>Pretty much any language you want to work will have some way of writing command line apps, from Ruby to Python to Node.js to C to Rust to Go. Especially when it comes to learning, you can just go for it and not worry much about technology choices.</p>
<p>But I think certain languages are better candidates for command line apps than others. Specifically languages that compile to a small, portable binary that's easy to install for users.</p>
<p>Let me break that down a bit more.</p>
<p>Let's take Ruby for example. Ruby is a scripting language that requires an installation of Ruby to be present to run. This means that if I write a Ruby program, for you to run it, you need to have Ruby installed. Or I need to package Ruby up and distribute it with the program. Ruby (and most programming languages) aren't small and super portable, so that's not really that fun. And installing Ruby is kind of a pain in the butt.</p>
<p>You know what'd be nice? If I could just provide you with a single file that you could run. And hopefully that file is pretty small. I don't want to waste your disk space or anything.</p>
<p>Well, that's what's called compiling down to a binary. The binary file is a packaged up version that can run on a lot of different computer operating systems without needing to have the language installed. Yay! Go and Rust in particular are really fantastic at this. You run some commands to compile the program and it can be used by others on the same OS as you. And it's not too difficult to generate it for other operating systems either.</p>
<p>So, it's not that Ruby isn't good for writing CLIs. I think the opposite! It's got a great standard library for it, and I find it quite intuitive and fun, especially for smaller scripts. Using Ruby for a CLI is great if you want to learn Ruby and that sort of programming. But it's not great for building programs you want to distrubte to others unless you know they will also have Ruby installed.</p>
<p>If I wanted to start a CLI project right now, I'd likely choose Rust or Go because I know it'd be possible to build and distribute the compiled version cross-platform.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="unix-utilities"><a class="header" href="#unix-utilities">Unix Utilities</a></h1>
<p>When working with the command line, it's likely you have used of the core Unix programs like <code>grep</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>less</code>, <code>tail</code>, or <code>sort</code>.</p>
<p>A great learning exercise is to rewrite those existing tools. Who knows, you might end up making a faster or better version.</p>
<p>One of the main concepts in Unix is being able to pipe data and chain together the commands. <code>cat foo.txt | grep bar</code>, that sort of thing. As part of rewriting these commands, you'll need to learn about <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, and more.</p>
<p>Here are some simpler utilities that would be good candidates for building:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cat</code> — output the contents of a file, line by line, to stdout</li>
<li><code>ls</code> — list the files of the current or passed in directory</li>
<li><code>grep</code> — search through the contents of target files for a match</li>
<li><code>less</code> — read-only file viewer, particulary useful for longer files</li>
<li><code>sort</code> — order lines alphanumerically</li>
<li><code>tail</code> — print last n lines of a file, can follow output with <code>-f</code>, useful for logs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The gist:</strong> CLI for checking a document or given folder of documents of plain text for typos.</p>
<p>An exercise in leveraging an existing dictionary and then reading files, checking them, and letting the user know about the issue and where it is.</p>
<p>If a typo is found, the program should exit with a non-zero status so it could be used as part of a CI pipeline or something.</p>
<p>It'd also be great if it could text in text via stdin via piping and such too!</p>

<pre><code>sc blog/2020-10-23-my-favorite-albums.md

<p>If it has no detected typos, then it would exit with a 0 status and not output anything. Silence is golden/no news is good news.</p>
<p>Let's say it has a typo, then it'd be non-zero and output to stderr:</p>
<pre><code>Typos found:
- Line 4, Col 45: &quot;teh&quot; appears to be a typo

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="find-and-replace-far"><a class="header" href="#find-and-replace-far">Find and Replace (far)</a></h1>
<p>As a Vim user, I'm pretty much always sweating large scale find and replace in my code. I'm going to be honest with you, I usually open up Sublime just for this since it's easy and works well. I know, I know, I'm probably doing Vim wrong.</p>
<p>But you know what? I'm over that! Well, I want to be over that. That's where this project comes into play.</p>
<p>I call it <code>far</code> in my head, for &quot;(f)ind (a)nd (r)eplace&quot;.</p>
<p>I think about it as a command-line app, but I think it could also have a graphical desktop wrapper too for those who would want that.</p>
<h2 id="example-usage"><a class="header" href="#example-usage">Example Usage</a></h2>
<p>Replace all instances of &quot;Foo&quot; with &quot;Bar&quot; in the current directory (and its children):</p>

<p>Really any programming language would work that can all out to the system IO. But what would make this project really ideal would be the abiliy to compile it easily into a dependency-free cross-platform binary that's easy to distribute.</p>

<p><strong>The gist:</strong> write a CLI that makes HTTP network requests and responds with the output.</p>
<p><code>curl</code> and <code>wget</code> are common programs used to transfer data to or from a server, like downloading a file over HTTP. This project is writing something similar to them. Start with just GET requests and then go from there.</p>
<p>I always call this idea <code>httpal</code> because it's kinda fun. It's your buddy for making requests!</p>
<h2 id="spec-1"><a class="header" href="#spec-1">Spec</a></h2>
<p>This could look something like:</p>
<pre><code>httpal https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7353617M.json

<p>That would make a GET request to that API endpoint for <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em> and return the JSON, which could then be output to a file like:</p>

<p>There will definitely be libraries out there that already do this for a given language, usually many of them. But the fun here is in taking a pretty manageable specification like Common Mark [TODO: check name] and writing your own parser and translator to HTML.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>It'd be great if you could send it via pipes too, like <code>cat foo.md | marcus &gt; foo.html</code></p>
<p>If you're building the CLI out, it'd also be nice to have a library that you can use in that language as well.</p>
<pre><code>Marus.to_html(&quot;# Hi\n[my link](/bye)\n&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Would output:</p>

<p>There are a lot of these, like TOML, YAML, Markdown, etc. But it'd be a worthwhile exercise to write your own so that you understand how they work. Whether the language is for authoring content intended to be HTML or a key-value configuration language, that's up to you. Just pick what sounds found and what you're interested in.</p>
<p>You'd want to:</p>

<p>Let's pretend that Markdown doesn't exist. Poof! It's gone. Who's Mark Down? Never met 'em.</p>
<p>Imagine I wanted a plain text way to describe some richer text that converts to HTML. Okay, let's define the spec.</p>
<p>Imagine there's a file in a fictional language called Brettdown (ugh, terrible name). The file is named <code>hello.bd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Hi, my name is Brett. Brettdown is my new minimal language for writing. !Bold! and ~italic~ are both quite nice.

Content can be lists:

* Twin Peaks
* X-Files

You can even add order, like my favorite fruits:

1) Apples
2) Dates
3) Blueberries

Links look like this: ^My Website{https://example.com}
</code></pre>
<p>Write a command-line tool that converts that file into HTML that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Brett. Brettdown is my new minimal language for writing. &lt;strong&gt;Bold&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt; are both quite nice.

<p>a.k.a. <em>PodBud</em></p>
<p>a.k.a. <em>Bring Your Own Hosting Podcast Tool</em></p>
<p>Podcasts are a wonderfully simple format. They leverage a feed, usually RSS, that can be consumed by clients who check regularly for new episodes and then add them to a library for a user to listen to.</p>
<p>The RSS feed contains the episodes and a link to the audio file and a bunch of metadata.</p>
<p>So what if there was a simple way to build and host a podcast RSS feed and files (and any other files, like a simple website) all from the command line without using a hosting platform?</p>
<p>It's sort of like the <a href="command-line-interfaces/./static-site-generator.html">Static Site Generator</a> but more focused on podcasts in particular and less on written content in Markdown.</p>
<h2 id="spec-3"><a class="header" href="#spec-3">Spec</a></h2>
<p>Directory contains something like:</p>
<pre><code>podcast.toml
assets/
  audio/
    1-title-slug-here.mp3
  images/
    1-title-slug-here.jpg
    artwork.jpg
episodes/
  1-title-slug-here.toml
  2-title-slug-here.toml
  3-title-slug-here.toml
README.md
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>podcast.toml</code> contains the global show details and info.</p>
<p>When the program is run, let's say it's called <code>podbud build</code> or something like that, then it would generate a <code>_build</code> directory that contains the RSS feed, the audio and image assets, and the episode TOML files.</p>
<p>The program would then have support for something like <code>podbud deploy</code> that would push the generated directory to something like Amazon AWS S3 or your own server or whatever for public consumption.</p>
<p>The process and flow would be ideal for using with some sort of CI service that builds and deploys whenever the show source is pushed somewhere or an episode is marked as published.</p>
<p>Here's what <code>podcast.toml</code> could look like for <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">title = &quot;Roderick on the Line&quot;
description = &quot;Merlin Mann's frank &amp; candid weekly phone call with John Roderick of The Long Winters&quot;
url = &quot;http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/&quot;
artwork = &quot;assets/images/artwork.jpg&quot; # defaults to this
language = &quot;en&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>There are more required ones details for a show, these are just some of them.</p>
<p>Imagine an <code>episode.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">title = &quot;Episode 00: Suit of Vomit&quot;
publish_date = 2011-09-09T07:32:00-08:00
description = &quot;&quot;&quot;
Our pilot episode.

Steak, Babies, Hitler, Molecules, Hearing Loss, and the Best of the Liberal Arts.

Pretty much what you’d expect.

<p>There are <em>so</em> many of these. Nearly every modern language has one. It's largely a solved problem, but I bet there's still some space for innovation and experimentation. Plus, it's a really great learning project.</p>
<p>There's basically no GUI. It's a command line app. Or well I guess you could have a GUI, that'd be a unique offering that most of the static site generators don't offer since their command line apps.</p>
<p>But the gist is that a static site generator takes a collection of text files and generates HTML pages that form a website. There's usually some form of processing from the input language to HTML (parsing) and then handling the templating.</p>
<p>You could only use the standard library for this or make use of existing packages by other developers. Whatever you want to learn.</p>
<p>But the output of the command would be site's HTML and any other assets that are needed and could then be deployed to a server and accessed.</p>
<p>There's also usually a need for specifying metadata as part of a given file.</p>
<p>The benefits of a static site generator is that the people building the site can author the content in a friendly, less cumbersome format than HTML like Markdown. And then the generated files can be hosted pretty much anywhere. You don't need to run a server yourself and deal with various requests. </p>
<p>Let's say the tool is called <code>ssg</code> and you had a folder with the following files for a band website:</p>
<pre><code>index.md
about.md
albums.md
tour.md
merch.md
</code></pre>
<p>When you run <code>ssg .</code> or just <code>ssg</code> it takes those files, converts them to HTML, and outputs them into the <code>build</code> directory or <code>site</code> dir or <code>_build</code>. Whatever you want to call it. Then that folder could be pushed somewhere for access.</p>
<p>There'd be:</p>
<pre><code>build/
  index.html
  about.html
  albums.html
  tour.html
  merch.html
</code></pre>
<p>And they'd be rendered with the proper semantic HTML with support for speciying metadata for the page. Starting with <code>title</code> and the meta <code>description</code> is enough to get started!</p>

<p>What follows are ideas for websites that you could build that don't require any back-end. This means there's no need for a database or a server to handle the requests. These are great ideas for getting started with web development by focusing on HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript, and some templating.</p>
<h2 id="starting-out"><a class="header" href="#starting-out">Starting Out</a></h2>
<p>You'll need an editor and a browser! That's it. That's part of the joy of building software for the web. There's not too much you need. Start with editing HTML and CSS directly and opening the file in your browser. Don't worry about content management systems like Wordpress or creating themes or templates. Start with the basics and go from there.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> is a commonly used and free editor. I'd suggest starting there.</p>
<p>With these projects, you'll learn about semantic structure, organizing information, making it look nice, and adding some light interactivity.</p>
<h2 id="resources-1"><a class="header" href="#resources-1">Resources</a></h2>
<p>Once you're comfortable with the basics of HTML and CSS, the best resource is your web browser's Developer Tools for inspecting the source and seeing how other sites are constructed. Any website that loads in your browser has source code you can look at to understand the elements being used and the styles that are applied to it.</p>

<h3 id="static-site-generators"><a class="header" href="#static-site-generators">Static Site Generators</a></h3>
<p>When you're building more complex websites beyond just a few pages, a static site generator (SSG) will be massively helpful for sharing page HTML across reuseable templates, authoring content in something other than HTML, and organizing the content.</p>
<p>There are <em>so</em> many static site generators that it's pretty exhausting. The nice thing is that they usuall y don't require you to know another language aside from whatever templating language they use (usually an extended HTML language).</p>
<p>Here are some of the ones I've used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.getzola.org">Zola</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="content-management-systems"><a class="header" href="#content-management-systems">Content Management Systems</a></h3>
<p>You may have heard of a Content Management System (CMS) before. Wordpress, a blogging tool, is a widely used CMS. Joomla is another popular one. They let you author content and manage your site, often via a web interface, with the ability to customize the site's templates. Content is often stored in a database, and they tend to be a bit more complex than SSGs under the hood.</p>
<p>You certainly can build a website with a CMS, but sometimes they hide the parts you want to learn via themes and templates. Wordpress is one of the earliest programming experiences I had, but it was years later until I started programming websites from scratch. I wish I had learned the fundamentals first.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="link-list"><a class="header" href="#link-list">Link List</a></h1>
<p>A Link List is a website that's just a list of links. Pretty simple! It's useful as a simple homepage or landing page for someone to use to collect all of their profiles online. I also call them Link Trees and Link-in-Bio websites.</p>
<p>A Link List is an ideal candidate for a learning project because it's simple (only one page and a few elements) and it's actually useful. You could build this and host it and actually use it for your own needs.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of https://brettchalupa.neocities.org — a Link List I build for myself as an example.</p>

<p>Ideas for what to share on your home page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects you've completed or are working on</li>
<li>Photos you've taken</li>
<li>Creative writing</li>
<li>Résumé, if that's something you want to share</li>

<p>I love keeping track of the books and movies I've watched. Sure, there are sites like Letterboxd and Goodreads to keep track of them, and they have all kinds of information and covers and such. But who needs all that?</p>
<p>For this project, build out a website to keep track of media you've finished. You could have a list of games you played, books you've read, your favorite albums, movies you've watched.</p>
<p>Would a table be nice for rendering columnar data like when you finished it, your rating, the author, etc.? Or maybe just a simple list?</p>

<p>If you're looking for an idea for a website with a bit more focus, build out a page for a particular product you're fascinated with. Maybe it's a video game console or type of cereal. I don't know what you're excited about. I'd probaby make a website dedicated to the core reasons why Saltines are underrated crackers. But that's just me.</p>
<p>A page specifically meant to feature a product will require you to think a bit more visually to really sell it. While the other website ideas are about building out basic content structures, a product page has a goal! Sell the product.</p>
<h2 id="spec-5"><a class="header" href="#spec-5">Spec</a></h2>

<p>What's something you absolutely love? The thing you know every single little detail about? The thing you won't stop talking to your friends about?</p>
<p>Take that idea and make a fansite. The fansite can be as complex or simple as you want it to be. Whether you code it by hand or use a static site generator, it's totally up to you. But the nice thing about a fansite is that you can build it and it can be done and exist. Sure, maybe you could update it from time to time, or you could just let it exist and share it with the world.</p>
<p>A fansite is the first thing I ever made on the web. When I was a teen, I used Geocities to make a fansite for the <em>Trigun</em> anime series, a show I was particularly obsessed with at the time. That was my first exposure to building websites, and I haven't stopped since. There's a real joy to writing about something you love.</p>
<p>A great fansite makes use of text and images and even videos. What sets it apart from something like Wikipedia is that it's about your fandom, not the facts. Write about what the thing means to you and how it has impacted you. Share your stories and thoughts.</p>
<p>Things I want to make fansites for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bright Eyes / Conor Oberst — my favorite band! I'd review each album and write about why I love his music so much</li>
<li>Twin Peaks — my favorite show! I guess maybe even just a David Lynch fansite would do</li>
<li>Haruki Murakami — my favorite author! I've read most of his books, and I'd be happy to write about him and what they mean to me</li>

<p>I find the idea of portable web components to be particularly compelling because they could be used and loaded on an as-needed basis and be much easier to integrate into a web page. In the past, when libraries would be primarily loaded via a JS <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and then be available globally, you had to ensure you set them up and configured and structured the DOM appropriately. Otherwise it would break. This is pretty brittle. </p>
<p>But with web components, the styles, logic, and DOM structure can be quite a bit more contained. How data gets passed into the component can vary and does require knowing the DOM strucutre, but I find it to be quite a bit more clear and simpler.</p>
<p>There are lots of web component libraries out there, but some primary ones to look at would be React, Vue, Lit, and Stencil. Or even just use what the DOM gives you natively without any sort of library.</p>
<p>These projects cover dealing with state, data, browser APIs, user interactions, and more.</p>
<h2 id="technologies-1"><a class="header" href="#technologies-1">Technologies</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Vanilla JS! [TODO: link to mdn]</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="image-gallery"><a class="header" href="#image-gallery">Image Gallery</a></h1>
<p>The idea here is to take a folder of images or a collection of links to images and render them in a grid and then be able to tap a given image to view a large version of it.</p>
<p>When viewing a single image, the user could use the left and right arrows to progress through the images in the gallery.</p>
<p>Learning areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rendering images</li>
<li>Grid rendering</li>
<li>State changing from grid to single image viewing</li>
<li>Handling user input, from tapping to keyboard</li>
</ul>
<p>Platforms/Tools/Technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web would be good! You could take a collection of URLs. I think it'd make a particular good web component that anyone could drop in and use. Something like:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;image-gallery&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://example.com/foo.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://example.com/bar.jpg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/image-gallery&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Or the data could be passed in through a property. Really up to you there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop/mobile -- desktop would prob be a little easier since accessing the file system isn't as cumbersome as on mobile apps, but still possible on things like iOS and Android for sure!</li>

<p>This is a really simple little project and component. It's basically just a way to take a YouTube video and embed it in a resilient way that can be responsive since that tends to be an issue when it comes to their default embed. It usually requires a CSS snippet, but it'd be nice to not need that. </p>
<p>Also, it'd make it possible to take the YT video URL or just the ID and render it accordingly.</p>
<p>Could support the various embed options too, like whether or not to have cookies. Starting at a certain time, etc.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="video-player"><a class="header" href="#video-player">Video Player</a></h1>
<p>I picture this as building a UI for dealing with a video, a lot like YouTube's or Vimeo's player. It would allow you to pause the video, change the volume, scrub to a specific timestamp, and make the video fullscreen.</p>
<p>The native video player is fine in most operating systems and browsers, but that doesn't mean more functionality couldn't be added.</p>

<p><strong>The gist</strong>: build out a public, read-only API that serves a variety of requests.</p>
<p>When first learning how to build an HTTP API, it can be helpful to just focus on the structure of the requests and responding with data. This project is focused on fetching data from a database and responding to HTTP requests with that data, in whatever format you want. It could be a GraphQL API or a JSON API you design yourself.</p>
<p>Then, once you have this read-only API, you can build clients that render the data returned from the API. That's a great way to learn how to build GUIs driven by data from an API.</p>
<h2 id="spec-8"><a class="header" href="#spec-8">Spec</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have some way to load the data that your API serves. Maybe you ingest the data into the data</li>
<li>Define read-only API endpoints to fetch and return the data</li>

<h2 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h2>
<p>I'd like to build out a GQL API that returns the albums with songs by <em>Guided By Voices</em>. They have such an extensive catalog, that'd it'd be fun to build out a GUI to browse them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">query albumsWithSongs {
  albums {
    title
    year
    coverUrl

    songs {
      trackNo
      title
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which would return something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;albumsWithSongs&quot;: {
      &quot;albums&quot;: [
        {

<p>The scope of this could really vary in its breadth! But the gist is to create a web app that allows restuarants to create a website that lets their patrons order online for pick-up. It would allow them to add menu items with their price and optional description.</p>
<p>Patrons could then view the website for the restaurant, add menu items to their order, and then pay for it to play it.</p>
<p>When an order is placed, the restuarant would then see in their dashboard an order has been placed. They can mark it as ready for pick up when it's been completed.</p>
<p>This would then notify the patron their food is ready for pick up.</p>
<p>I'd call this GrubBud, or maybe that's too close to the real thing. How about iMenu and get all 2000s Steve Jobs on it??? Call it what ya' want!</p>

<p>This is basically a full stack web app. For learning purposes, you could have it just be for one restaurant with HTTP basic auth for the Admin area. Or build out an entire sign up flow! Whatever you want.</p>
<p>But there's a lot to this.</p>
<p>If I was an educator who was teaching a course or writing a book on building web apps, I would use this as a class project because it is non-trivial, has levels of access control, includes interacting with APIs for payment process and notifications, has state management, and very likely has a database. It's also not just another blogging engine or Twitter clone or todo app. Plus! A lot of people can relate to and understand the concepts behind this because they've placed orders for food online. And if they haven't, if they've eaten out, the concepts are close enough to map to the technological needs. </p>

<p>Ah, yes, the old calculator. The TI-98. Well, that's pretty advanced. But here the goal is to build a simple calculator that can do the basic mathematical functions. Ideally it'd be able to add, subtract, multiple, divide.</p>
<p>In a very simplistic way, what this project is doing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking user input and sanitizing it</li>
<li>Passing it along to the math library in the language you're using</li>
<li>Displaying the result</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform for this could be really just about anything!</p>
<ul>
<li>Command line math tool that parses a string with an equation and prints the results</li>
<li>Desktop or mobile app GUI</li>
<li>Little web app or component using TypeScript or JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good project for trying out all sorts of languages and libraries. It doesn't require a data store or networking. It doesn't require an overly complex UI. But it's also not extremely trivial. There's some state to manage and data to sanitize.</p>

<p>The gist: build a program that opens up a zip file of images (without extracting them) and allows the user to flip to the next page until the end of the archive.</p>
<p>DRM-free comic files are generally found in a few different archive formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.zip</code> -- just a zip collection of images</li>
<li><code>.cbz</code> -- just a zip file, from my understanding</li>
<li>[rar one???]</li>
</ul>
<p>And then within could be any number of image formats. JPGs, PNGs, even TIFFs.</p>
<p>What this project exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspecting the contents of an archive file</li>
<li>Rendering images potentially in a variety of formats</li>
<li>Handling user input to go the next page or previous page</li>
</ul>
<p>[link to examples of free comics in the format]</p>
<p>[examples of the UI or wireframes]</p>
<p>This project is pretty GUI heavy but has the added complexity of viewing the image files within the archive.</p>
<p>Some ideas for tooling, technology, and platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS/iPad OS/MacOS -- a really good project for learning Swift on those platforms</li>
<li>Android -- I think a pretty good project for that, like learning Kotlin</li>
<li>Desktop GUI app -- something like GTK or QT would make a good fit or even Vala or rust-gtk (check name)</li>
<li>Electron -- this would be a pretty fun little desktop project for Electron if you're a web dev interested in learning how to use it. You could leverage your web skills while learning that.</li>
</ul>
<p>You could leverage a library to open up an archive and view the files or you could code that yourself using the language's standard library. There's lots of deep dives that could be done here.</p>

<p>Okay! Heads up here. This is obviously a risky one. I probably wouldn't release this as open source unless you're knowledgable and confident. Maybe keep this one closed source and be wary. Just because wow! There seems like there's some risk here with sensitive info.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not a security or crytopgraphic expert. So, like, wow! There's a lot to consider here and learn. But that's the point of these. </p>
<p>All right, enough caveats. Do and share your own risk!</p>
<p>But the gist of the idea is to build an app that can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate secure password of varying length and complexity</li>
<li>Keep track of generated passwords</li>
<li>Be able to associate a username, email, URL, etc. for the password</li>
<li>Encrypt all the stored info</li>
<li>Be able to decrypt to get the data for yourself to use</li>
</ul>
<p>What you'll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI for creating, managing, and viewing the generated passwords</li>
<li>Storing the data</li>
<li>Crytography with securely storing the data so others can't view the data</li>

<p>Many programming languages have great support for loading and using code written by others within your own code. These are called libraries. They often make it easier to do something that's otherwise difficult or annoying to do on your own. They're also helpful for reading how other people program, as the source code for open source libraries is accessible to read.</p>
<p>Languages sometimes have their own names for libraries... Sometimes their called packaged or dependencies. Ruby calls them Gems. Rust calls them Crates. Node/NPM/Yarn calls them Packages. They're all generally referring to the same things—code written by others that you can use.</p>
<p>Maybe you find yourself repeating the same three lines of code over and over and you'd like to make it one. That's a great case for a small library! Or maybe you've written some code that's not specific to your project and could be used by others. That's a great case for a library too!</p>
<p>The projects that follow are ideas for projects you could write that others could use. Each language has a different way of sharing libraries with others, so you'll have to do some research into whatever language you're using.</p>
<p>Writing an open source library can be a lot of fun and quite rewarding. Instead of a graphical interface or a command line interface, you’re defining a programming interface (API) for others to use and integrate with.</p>
<p>You’ll want to have well thoughtout functions and sensible naming. And you’ll want to have thorough documentation to make it clear to use. But don't worry if there are issues as you're starting out, you'll get better the more you build libraries and APIs.</p>
<p>Whether or not you open source the code you write is up to you. Consider how finished your code is and if it's stable enough for others to use. Writing your own version of a popular library can be a great way to learn a language.</p>
<p>What writing libraries are great for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing focused code that accomplishes one thing (or a few related things) really well</li>
<li>Learning API design and documentation</li>
<li>Writing well-tested code</li>
<li>Getting more familiar with open source</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The gist:</strong> wrap the language you're learning's HTTP interface with a more friendly API.</p>
<p>Many programming languages come with libraries for making HTTP requests since it's such a common need for programmers. Sometimes the interfaces that the standard libraries provides aren't that intuitive.</p>
<h2 id="an-example-1"><a class="header" href="#an-example-1">An Example</a></h2>
<p>Let's look at what this could be like with Ruby. Ruby provides the <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-3.0.3/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html"><code>net/http</code> library</a> for making HTTP requests.</p>
<p>You would use it like this to fetch the JSON from a URL and retiurn it as a Hash in Ruby:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'net/http'
require 'json'
url = URI('https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7353617M.json')
response_body = Net::HTTP.get(url)
res = JSON.parse(response_body)
</code></pre>
<p><code>res</code> (truncated) is a Ruby Hash that looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">{
  &quot;publishers&quot;=&gt;[&quot;Puffin&quot;],
  &quot;number_of_pages&quot;=&gt;96,
  &quot;isbn_10&quot;=&gt;[&quot;0140328726&quot;],
  &quot;covers&quot;=&gt;[8739161],
  &quot;key&quot;=&gt;&quot;/books/OL7353617M&quot;,
  &quot;authors&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;key&quot;=&gt;&quot;/authors/OL34184A&quot;}],
  &quot;ocaid&quot;=&gt;&quot;fantasticmrfoxpu00roal&quot;,
  &quot;contributions&quot;=&gt;[&quot;Tony Ross (Illustrator)&quot;],
  &quot;languages&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;key&quot;=&gt;&quot;/languages/eng&quot;}]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of repeating those three lines of code for every single request you want to make to get the parsed body, you could write a library for it.</p>
<p>Let's say the library is called <code>Hyper</code>, for the &quot;Hyper&quot; in HTTP. It might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'net/http'
require 'json'

class Hyper
  def self.get(url)
    url = URI(url)
    response_body = Net::HTTP.get(url)
    JSON.parse(response_body)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>All you would have to do is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">Hyper.get('https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7353617M.json')
</code></pre>
<p>To have the same output as before.</p>
<p>You'd then package that code up and share it as a library to use it in your various projects and for others to use.</p>
<p>This is a very simplified example, but I think it illustrates what this project could look like. A good library would validate the input, provide helpful errors, and allow specifying the needed options.</p>
<p>In the case of Ruby, if this was published as a Gem, people would install it in their <code>Gemfile</code> and use it throughout their code. Pretty neat!</p>

<ul>
<li>Add support for POST, PUT, and DELETE methods</li>
<li>Support specifying authentication headers</li>
<li>Raise errors when the HTTP response is not successful</li>
<li>Follow redirects</li>
<li>An HTTP library is quite nice. Something even neater would be a library that specifically makes making GraphQL requests easier since they're always to the same endpoint but the request body varies. Seems like a good case for a library!</li>

<p><strong>The gist</strong>: write a wrapper for an HTTP API to make it easier to work the endpoints and returned data.</p>
<p>When consuming an API, especially a foundational one to your application, it can be much easier to interact with a library written in the programming language you're using rather than making HTTP requests and parsing the response every single time. By building an API wrapper, you'll be able to create a more idiomatic API for the language you're using in, make configuring the API easier, and have more control over consistently manipulating the response.</p>

<p>Let's say I want to display a random dog photo in my application whenever a user views a given page. I could use <a href="https://dog.ceo/dog-api/">the Dog API</a> for that. If I'm working with Ruby, I could make the request using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'net/http'
require 'json'
url = URI('https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random')
response_body = Net::HTTP.get(url)
res = JSON.parse(response_body)
res[&quot;message&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>That's kind of a bummer to use every time I want a random dog image! Sure, <a href="libraries/./http-client.html">an HTTP client</a>, would reduce that burden, but maybe I want to display different dog photos throughout my app and want to reuse that code. I'd introduce something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'net/http'
require 'json'

class DogApi
  RANDOM_URL = 'https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random'.freeze

  def self.random_image_url
    response_body = Net::HTTP.get(URI(RANDOM_URL))
    JSON.parse(response_body)[&quot;message&quot;]
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Then in my application, all I would have to do is call <code>DogApi.random_image_url</code> to have a URL returned for a dog image. Much simpler.</p>
<p>The above code is a bit... naive. It doesn't handle errors, which could certainly happen. What if the API is down or we get rate limited? We'd want something useful to happen for those using the wrapper. That's part of the joy of using an API wrapper. The best API wrappers handle errors and respond in a away appropriate for the language. For Ruby code, it could raise an exception.</p>
<p>Even within just one class and a class method, there are some design decisions I made. I called the wrapper <code>DogApi</code> instead of just <code>Dog</code> because it's more specific, and <code>Dog</code> is too generic of a name in my opinion. I wouldn't want to inadvertantly interfere with it. I also named the method <code>.random_image_url</code> because it makes it clear what's returned—a URL to the image. If it was just called <code>.random</code>, it wouldn't be clear what's returned—is it a hash, a <code>Dog</code> object, or an image URL?</p>
<p>There is a fine line to walk when developing an API wrapper. You want to remain true to the API you're wrapping so that the patterns and names aren't wildely inconsistent, but you also want to be clear and use the idioms of the language you're using.</p>

<p>Games are a great way to learn programming because they contain a lot of concepts that vary in complexity, from loops to arrays to input to rendering graphics to data modeling. Game rules often translate nicely to programming logic.</p>
<p>But games can also be challenging because there's so much going on! There's music, graphics, input, text, and more to manage. It can be a lot to digest and understand. Starting with simpler games will help you understand core concepts and build up from there. It's best to not start by building your dream fantasy anthropomorphic MMORPG.</p>
<p>Most languages have a way to program games in them. While there are pros and cons to different languages, don't worry too much about that when you're learning. The skills in one language will apply to another if you so choose to switch.</p>
<h2 id="game-libraries--frameworks"><a class="header" href="#game-libraries--frameworks">Game Libraries &amp; Frameworks</a></h2>
<p>I recommend using libraries and frameworks when learning programming via making games. Engines like Unreal, Unity, GameMaker, and Godot are all worthwhile and will help you make games, for sure. But they abstract (hide) a lot of what's happening in a way that isn't always intuitive when learning to code. You certainly can and should use those if you're interested in them! But a lot of the game projects in <em>Playbook</em> are simplistic and geared towards coding outside of a GUI-based game engine.</p>
