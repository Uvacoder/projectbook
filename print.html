<p><strong>Learn By Doing</strong></p>
<p>~or~</p>
<p><strong>The Great Big List of Software Project Ideas</strong></p>
<p><em>Projectbook</em> is a collection of over 50 software project ideas for people looking to learn a given language or technology but short on inspiration for what to build. These projects tend to vary in complexity and what they exercise.</p>
<p>My goal with this collection is to provide detailed enough specifications for what could exist to complete a project or gibe enough detail to get started.</p>
<p>I've found that a lot of software tutorials are too simple and basic and that I only really learn through building something.</p>
<p>When learning a new programming language or library or technology, there's so much to take in that having to figure out what to build and what it should and shouldn't do can be enough friction to slow down any momentum and fun you're having.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, these projects are just me sharing software and tools that I want to build myself.</p>
<p>Often a simple todo app is the non-trivial example project that people point to. It's a fine one because it has a variety of needs and state management. But it's so boring! And overdone! So these are the ideas beyond the todo list app.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-learning-project"><a class="header" href="#what-makes-a-good-learning-project">What Makes a Good Learning Project</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Non-trivial -- more complex than &quot;hello world&quot; but less complex than a video editor</li>
<li>A simple core with additional, more complex functionality to add</li>
<li>Clear in what it does and doesn't do</li>
<li>Something you understand from using yourself so you can more easily map the domain into code</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mindset"><a class="header" href="#mindset">Mindset</a></h2>
<p>Please, please, please don't go into these projects thinking, &quot;Wow, this idea is going to make me rich! It's the next start-up! It's the next big thing! Get those angel investors on the line!&quot; I fall into this trap from time to time, especially when I'm dreaming big. I start thinking about monetization and hosting and the viability of something existing as a business. What you're trying to do is learn! Not start a business. Don't burden yourself with the responsibiity of doing anything other than experimenting at the beginning.</p>
<p>If you were to learn how to play guitar and you're playing simplified covers of your favorite songs, which is basically what we're doing here, would you start by thinking about how you'll record, mix, master, and release your cover album to make you rich? No! You'd practice them, play them for friends, maybe record them. Maybe one day you'd be in a cover band. Or even start writing your own original music. But don't concern yourself with anything other than learning and having fun right now.</p>
<h2 id="reading-order"><a class="header" href="#reading-order">Reading Order</a></h2>
<p>Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) are first because I think they're generally a nice place to start because they don't require graphic rendering and a GUI. This makes their interfaces quite a bit simpler since there are only so many forms of input and output.</p>
<p>Some types of projects won't make sense for certain technologies. If you want to learn HTML, then ideas for CLIs won't be much help for you.</p>
<p>However, don't read this book as you would a normal linear book. It's instead meant to be a place to browse around, experiment, find inspiration, and start hacking away and learning.</p>
<h2 id="wireframes--design-assets"><a class="header" href="#wireframes--design-assets">Wireframes &amp; Design Assets</a></h2>
<p>For projects with a GUI, it can be daunting to think about what it will look like and even potential assets.</p>
<p>Not a designer? That's totally okay!</p>
<p>Throughout the projects, you'll find wireframes, specs, and assets. You're welcome to use them or disregard them. Whatever you want. It's your project! Your learning. I'm just trying to help.</p>
<p>The nice thing about building GUI apps is that there are lots of graphical libraries and toolkits that you can utilize without designing or coding them from scratch, from things like GTK to Apple's platforms' various libraries to Material Design to Bootstrap. </p>
<p>Don't worry too much about it looking generic or boring when you're learning, unless what you're learning is how to polish a GUI! It really depends on what you want to get out of your project. Whether you use libraries or existing code or do it all from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="who-the-heck-am-i"><a class="header" href="#who-the-heck-am-i">Who the Heck Am I?</a></h2>
<p><img src="./brett-mii.png" alt="animated gif of rotating cartoon head that looks like brett in the style of Nintendo's Mii" /></p>
<p>I am Brett! Nice to meet you. Thanks for checking this out. I'm a software programmer who has been doing some form of coding since I was 13. Professionally, I build web applications and APIs with Ruby, Rails, TypeScript, GraphQL, and web components. Personally, I dabble with all sorts of programming, from CLIs to game dev. I like checking out new languages and frameworks on the regular.</p>
<p>Since I'm not, let's say, a software programmer for smart refridgerators, there aren't a ton of ideas related to smart refridgerators. The focus is more on the software I use regularly or have to build. This is great because I understand the needs and functionality, which means I don't have to think too much about why something needs to do something and can instead focus on learning the technology.</p>
<p>I'd love to have more project ideas for different types of programming, like network programming and embedded hardware and such. Hopefully in the future!</p>

<p>Anyone is welcome to use the project ideas in this book to build software and try to make money if that's your aim. Best of luck.</p>
<p>I hope most of all that you have fun and learn with these ideas. But if you build the Next Big App or whatever from one of these ideas, kudos to you.</p>
<p>Also, ideas aren't worth much. What matters is what you make from those ideas!</p>
<h2 id="contributing"><a class="header" href="#contributing">Contributing</a></h2>
<p>Do you have an idea for a project? Contribute it!</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="command-line-interfaces"><a class="header" href="#command-line-interfaces">Command Line Interfaces</a></h1>
<p>Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) are programs run from the terminal or command prompt. They're extremely broad in scope, as they can be used for any sort of computing—from starting a server to interacting with files.</p>
<p>Building a command line interface is great for learning a new language because you don't have to worry about the graphical interface and visual design. You can instead focus on the interactions and the work the program does. This simplifies things quite a bit. It also lets you learn the language's standard library, as most make writing CLIs quite easy.</p>
<p>If you use a lot of command line apps, then I imagine you'll be drawn to coding your own. It's a lot of fun. And no matter how simple the program is, all that matters is that it's useful. The Unix philosophy of small programs that can be chained together is really great for learning and building tools and commands.</p>
<h2 id="mindset--targets"><a class="header" href="#mindset--targets">Mindset / Targets</a></h2>
<p>Pretty much any language you want to work will have some way of writing command line apps, from Ruby to Python to Node.js to C to Rust to Go. <strong>Especially when it comes to learning, you can just go for it and not worry much about technology choices.</strong></p>
<p>But I think certain languages are better candidates for command line apps than others. Specifically languages that compile to a small, portable binary that's easy to install for users.</p>
<p>Let me break that down a bit more.</p>
<p>Let's take Ruby for example. Ruby is a scripting language that requires an installation of Ruby to be present to run. This means that if I write a Ruby program, for you to run it, you need to have Ruby installed. Or I need to package Ruby up and distribute it with the program. Ruby (and most programming languages) aren't small and super portable, so that's not really that fun. And installing Ruby is kind of a pain in the butt.</p>
<p>You know what'd be nice? If I could just provide you with a single file that you could run. And hopefully that file is pretty small. I don't want to waste your disk space or anything.</p>
<p>Well, that's what's called compiling down to a binary. The binary file is a packaged up version that can run on a lot of different computer operating systems without needing to have the language installed. Yay! Go and Rust in particular are really fantastic at this. You run some commands to compile the program and it can be used by others on the same OS as you. And it's not too difficult to generate it for other operating systems either.</p>
<p>So, it's not that Ruby isn't good for writing CLIs. I think the opposite! It's got a great standard library for it, and I find it quite intuitive and fun, especially for smaller scripts. Using Ruby for a CLI is great if you want to learn Ruby and that sort of programming. But it's not great for building programs you want to distrubte to others unless you know they will also have Ruby installed.</p>
<p>If I wanted to start a CLI project right now, I'd likely choose Rust or Go because I know it'd be possible to build and distribute the compiled version cross-platform.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="custom-markup-language"><a class="header" href="#custom-markup-language">Custom Markup Language</a></h1>
<p>There are a lot of these, like TOML, YAML, Markdown, etc. But it'd be a worthwhile exercise to write your own so that you understand how they work. Whether the language is for authoring content intended to be HTML or a key-value configuration language, that's up to you. Just pick what sounds found and what you're interested in.</p>
<p>You'd want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>define the spec</li>
<li>write out some examples</li>
<li>build code that can read it and load it and do whatever with it</li>

<p>Let's pretend that Markdown doesn't exist. Poof! It's gone. Who's Mark Down? Never met 'em.</p>
<p>Imagine I wanted a plain text way to describe some richer text that converts to HTML. Okay, let's define the spec.</p>
<p>Imagine there's a file in a fictional language called Brettdown (ugh, terrible name). The file is named <code>hello.bd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Hi, my name is Brett. Brettdown is my new minimal language for writing. !Bold! and ~italic~ are both quite nice.

Content can be lists:

* Twin Peaks
* X-Files

You can even add order, like my favorite fruits:

1) Apples
2) Dates
3) Blueberries

Links look like this: ^My Website{https://example.com}
</code></pre>
<p>Write a command-line tool that converts that file into HTML that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Brett. Brettdown is my new minimal language for writing. &lt;strong&gt;Bold&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt; are both quite nice.

<p>But you know what? I'm over that! Well, I want to be over that. That's where this project comes into play.</p>
<p>I call it <code>far</code> in my head, for &quot;(f)ind (a)nd (r)eplace&quot;.</p>

<p>a.k.a. <em>PodBud</em></p>
<p>a.k.a. <em>Bring Your Own Hosting Podcast Tool</em></p>
<p>Podcasts are a truly wonderfully simple format. They leverage a feed, usually RSS, that can be consumed by clients who check regularly for new episodes and then add them to a library for a user to listen to.</p>
<p>The RSS feed contains the episodes and a link to the audio file and a bunch of metadata.</p>
<p>So what if there was a simple way to build and host a podcast RSS feed and files (and any other files, like a simple website) all from the command line without using a hosting platform?</p>
<p>It's sort of like the <a href="command-line-interfaces/./static-site-generator.html">Static Site Generator</a> but more focused on podcasts in particular and less on written content in Markdown.</p>
<h2 id="spec-2"><a class="header" href="#spec-2">Spec</a></h2>

<pre><code>podcast.toml

    1-title-slug-here.jpg
    artwork.jpg
episodes/
  1-title-slug-here.toml
  2-title-slug-here.toml
  3-title-slug-here.toml
README.md
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>podcast.toml</code> contains the global show details and info.</p>
<p>When the program is run, let's say it's called <code>podbud build</code> or something like that, then it would generate a <code>_build</code> directory that contains the RSS feed, the audio and image assets, and the episode TOML files.</p>
<p>The program would then have support for something like <code>podbud deploy</code> that would push the generated directory to something like Amazon AWS S3 or your own server or whatever for public consumption.</p>
<p>The process and flow would be ideal for using with some sort of CI service that builds and deploys whenever the show source is pushed somewhere or an episode is marked as published.</p>
<p><code>show.toml</code>:</p>

<p>There are <em>so</em> many of these. Nearly every modern language has one. It's largely a solved problem, but I bet there's still some space for innovation and experimentation. Plus, it's a really great learning project.</p>
<p>There's basically no GUI. It's a command line app. Or well I guess you could have a GUI, that'd be a unique offering that most of the static site generators don't offer since their command line apps.</p>
<p>But the gist is that a static site generator takes a collection of text files and generates HTML pages that form a website. There's usually some form of processing from the input language to HTML (parsing) and then handling the templating.</p>
<p>You could only use the standard library for this or make use of existing packages by other developers. Whatever you want to learn.</p>
<p>But the output of the command would be site's HTML and any other assets that are needed and could then be deployed to a server and accessed.</p>
<p>There's also usually a need for specifying metadata as part of a given file.</p>
<p>The benefits of a static site generator is that the people building the site can author the content in a friendly, less cumbersome format than HTML like Markdown. And then the generated files can be hosted pretty much anywhere. You don't need to run a server yourself and deal with various requests. </p>
<p>Let's say the tool is called <code>ssg</code> and you had a folder with the following files for a band website:</p>
<pre><code>index.md
about.md
albums.md
tour.md
merch.md
</code></pre>
<p>When you run <code>ssg .</code> or just <code>ssg</code> it takes those files, converts them to HTML, and outputs them into the <code>build</code> directory or <code>site</code> dir or <code>_build</code>. Whatever you want to call it. Then that folder could be pushed somewhere for access.</p>
<p>There'd be:</p>
<pre><code>build/
  index.html
  about.html
  albums.html
  tour.html
  merch.html
</code></pre>
<p>And they'd be rendered with the proper semantic HTML with support for speciying metadata for the page. Starting with <code>title</code> and the meta <code>description</code> is enough to get started!</p>

<p>When working with the command line, it's likely you have used of the core Unix programs like <code>grep</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>less</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>sort</code>, and more.</p>
<p>One way to learn a language is to rewrite those existing tools' functionality. Who knows, you might end up making a faster or better version.</p>
<p>One of the main concepts is being able to pipe data and chain together the commands. <code>cat foo.txt | grep bar</code>, that sort of thing. As part of rewriting these commands, you'll need to learn about <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, and more.</p>
<p>Here are some simpler utilities that would be good candidates for building:</p>

<li><code>grep</code> — search through the contents of target files for a match</li>
<li><code>ls</code> — list the files of the current or passed in directory</li>
<li><code>less</code> — read-only file viewer, particulary useful for longer files</li>

<p>What follows are ideas for websites that you could build that don't require any back-end. This means there's no need for a database or a server to manage the requests. These are great ideas for getting started with web development by focusing on HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript, and some templating.</p>
<h2 id="starting-out"><a class="header" href="#starting-out">Starting Out</a></h2>
<p>You'll need an editor and a browser! That's it. That's part of the joy of building software for the web. There's not too much you need. Start with editing HTML and CSS directly. Don't worry about content management systems like Wordpress or creating themes or templates. Start with the basics and go from there.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> is a commonly used and free editor. I'd suggest starting there.</p>
<p>With these projects, you'll learn about semantic structure, organizing information, making it look nice, and adding some light interactivity.</p>
<h2 id="resources-1"><a class="header" href="#resources-1">Resources</a></h2>
<p>Once your comfortable with the bare basics of HTML and CSS, the best resource is your web browser's Developer Tools for inspecting the source and seeing how other sites do it. Any website that loads in your browser has source code you can look at to understand the elements being used and the styles that are applied to it.</p>

<p>When you're building more complex websites beyond just a few pages, a static site generator (SSG) will be massively helpful for sharing page HTML across reuseable templates, authoring content in something other than HTML, and organizing the content.</p>
<p>There are <em>so</em> many static site generators that it's pretty exhausting. The nice thing is that they usuall y don't require you to know another language aside from whatever templating language they use (usually an extended HTML language).</p>

<p>I love keeping track of the books and movies I've watched. Sure, there are sites like Letterboxd and Goodreads to keep track of them, and they have all kinds of information and covers and such. But who needs all that?</p>
<p>For this project, build out a website to keep track of media you've finished. You could have a list of games you played, books you've read, your favorite albums, movies you've watched.</p>
<p>Would a table be nice for rendering columnar data like when you finished it, your rating, the author, etc.? Or maybe just a simple list?</p>

<p>What's something you absolutely love? The thing you know every single little detail about? The thing you won't stop talking to your friends about?</p>
<p>Take that idea and make a fansite. The fansite can be as complex or simple as you want it to be. Whether you code it by hand or use a static site generator, it's totally up to you. But the nice thing about a fansite is that you can build it and it can be done and exist. Sure, maybe you could update it from time to time, or you could just let it exist and share it with the world.</p>
<p>A fansite is the first thing I ever made on the web. When I was a teen, I used Geocities to make a fansite for the <em>Trigun</em> anime series, a show I was particularly obsessed with at the time. That was my first exposure to building websites, and I haven't stopped since. There's a real joy to writing about something you love.</p>
<p>A great fansite makes use of text and images and even videos. What sets it apart from something like Wikipedia is that it's about your fandom, not the facts. Write about what the thing means to you and how it has impacted you. Share your stories and thoughts.</p>
<p>Things I want to make fansites for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bright Eyes / Conor Oberst -- my favorite band! I'd review each album and write about why I love his music so much</li>
<li>Twin Peaks -- my favorite show! I guess maybe even just a David Lynch fansite would do</li>
<li>Haruki Murakami -- my favorite author! I've read most of his books, and I'd be happy to write about him and what they mean to me</li>

<p>The scope of this could really vary in its breadth! But the gist is to create a web app that allows restuarants to create a website that lets their patrons order online for pick-up. It would allow them to add menu items with their price and optional description.</p>
<p>Patrons could then view the website for the restaurant, add menu items to their order, and then pay for it to play it.</p>
<p>When an order is placed, the restuarant would then see in their dashboard an order has been placed. They can mark it as ready for pick up when it's been completed.</p>
<p>This would then notify the patron their food is ready for pick up.</p>
<p>I'd call this GrubBud, or maybe that's too close to the real thing. How about iMenu and get all 2000s Steve Jobs on it??? Call it what ya' want!</p>

<p>This is basically a full stack web app. For learning purposes, you could have it just be for one restaurant with HTTP basic auth for the Admin area. Or build out an entire sign up flow! Whatever you want.</p>
<p>But there's a lot to this.</p>
<p>If I was an educator who was teaching a course or writing a book on building web apps, I would use this as a class project because it is non-trivial, has levels of access control, includes interacting with APIs for payment process and notifications, has state management, and very likely has a database. It's also not just another blogging engine or Twitter clone or todo app. Plus! A lot of people can relate to and understand the concepts behind this because they've placed orders for food online. And if they haven't, if they've eaten out, the concepts are close enough to map to the technological needs. </p>

<p>I find the idea of portable web components to be particular compelling because they could be used and loaded on an as-needed basis and be much easier to integrate into a web page. In the past, when libraries would be primarily loaded via a JS <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and then be available globally, you had to ensure you set them up and configured and structured the DOM appropriately. Otherwise it would break. This is pretty brittle. </p>
<p>But with web components, the styles, logic, and DOM structure can be quite a bit more contained. How data gets passed into the component can vary and does require knowing the DOM strucutre, but I find it to be quite a bit more clear and simpler.</p>
<p>There are lots of web component libraries out there, but some primary ones to look at would be React, Vue, Lit, and Stencil. Or even just use what the DOM gives you natively without any sort of library.</p>
<p>These projects in particular would have you dealing with state, data, browser APIs, user interactions, etc.</p>
<h2 id="technologies-1"><a class="header" href="#technologies-1">Technologies</a></h2>

<li>Vanilla JS! [TODO: link to mdn]</li>

<p>The idea here is to take a folder of images or a collection of links to images and render them in a grid and then be able to tap a given image to view a large version of it.</p>
<p>When viewing a single image, the user could use the left and right arrows to progress through the images in the gallery.</p>
<p>Learning areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rendering images</li>
<li>Grid rendering</li>
<li>State changing from grid to single image viewing</li>
<li>Handling user input, from tapping to keyboard</li>
</ul>
<p>Platforms/Tools/Technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web would be good! You could take a collection of URLs. I think it'd make a particular good web component that anyone could drop in and use. Something like:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;image-gallery&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://example.com/foo.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://example.com/bar.jpg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/image-gallery&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Or the data could be passed in through a property. Really up to you there.</p>

<p>Lit and Stencil and Svetle interest me in particular for this. I think it'd need to be easy to load into any given web page or app.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="prose-renderer"><a class="header" href="#prose-renderer">Prose Renderer</a></h1>
<p>I tend to think of this as a library or component called <code>Prose.js</code> or <code>Reader.js</code> that is concerned with taking a nested collection of <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements in partidular and rendering them in a way that gives the user fine grain control over how it's rendered. Their preferences would be stored in <code>localstorage</code> so upon refresh their settings would load and be used across web pages (like chapters in a book).</p>
<p>Essentially Kindle's reading options</p>
<p>Configuration options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text size</li>
<li>Text weight</li>
<li>Font</li>
<li>Text alignment -- justified or left aligned or right aligned</li>
<li>Line spacing</li>
<li>Margins</li>
</ul>

<p>Usage:</p>

<li>include the script to load the source</li>
<li>just use the component! wrap the output for the prose in the component:</li>
</ol>

&lt;/Prose&gt;

<h2 id="tech-1"><a class="header" href="#tech-1">Tech</a></h2>
<p>Any of the major web component libraries are appealing for this, in particular ones that can generate a portable component that can be easily loaded and dropped in like Stencil. Svelte and Lit appeal to me too.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="responsive-youtube-video-embed"><a class="header" href="#responsive-youtube-video-embed">Responsive YouTube Video Embed</a></h1>
<p>This is a really simple little project and component. It's basically just a way to take a YouTube video and embed it in a resilient way that can be responsive since that tends to be an issue when it comes to their default embed. It usually requires a CSS snippet, but it'd be nice to not need that. </p>
<p>Also, it'd make it possible to take the YT video URL or just the ID and render it accordingly.</p>
<p>Could support the various embed options too, like whether or not to have cookies. Starting at a certain time, etc.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="video-player"><a class="header" href="#video-player">Video Player</a></h1>
<p>I picture this as building a UI for dealing with a video, a lot like YouTube's or Vimeo's player. It would allow you to pause the video, change the volume, scrub to a specific timestamp, and make the video fullscreen.</p>
<p>The native video player is fine in most operating systems and browsers, but that doesn't mean more functionality couldn't be added.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="calculator"><a class="header" href="#calculator">Calculator</a></h1>
<p>Ah, yes, the old calculator. The TI-98. Well, that's pretty advanced. But here the goal is to build a simple calculator that can do the basic mathematical functions. Ideally it'd be able to add, subtract, multiple, divide.</p>
<p>In a very simplistic way, what this project is doing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking user input and sanitizing it</li>
<li>Passing it along to the math library in the language you're using</li>
<li>Displaying the result</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform for this could be really just about anything!</p>
<ul>
<li>Command line math tool that parses a string with an equation and prints the results</li>
<li>Desktop or mobile app GUI</li>
<li>Little web app or component using TypeScript or JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good project for trying out all sorts of languages and libraries. It doesn't require a data store or networking. It doesn't require an overly complex UI. But it's also not extremely trivial. There's some state to manage and data to sanitize.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="comic-reader"><a class="header" href="#comic-reader">Comic Reader</a></h1>
<p>The gist: build a program that opens up a zip file of images (without extracting them) and allows the user to flip to the next page until the end of the archive.</p>
<p>DRM-free comic files are generally found in a few different archive formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.zip</code> -- just a zip collection of images</li>
<li><code>.cbz</code> -- just a zip file, from my understanding</li>
<li>[rar one???]</li>
</ul>
<p>And then within could be any number of image formats. JPGs, PNGs, even TIFFs.</p>
<p>What this project exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspecting the contents of an archive file</li>
<li>Rendering images potentially in a variety of formats</li>
<li>Handling user input to go the next page or previous page</li>
</ul>
<p>[link to examples of free comics in the format]</p>
<p>[examples of the UI or wireframes]</p>
<p>This project is pretty GUI heavy but has the added complexity of viewing the image files within the archive.</p>
<p>Some ideas for tooling, technology, and platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS/iPad OS/MacOS -- a really good project for learning Swift on those platforms</li>
<li>Android -- I think a pretty good project for that, like learning Kotlin</li>
<li>Desktop GUI app -- something like GTK or QT would make a good fit or even Vala or rust-gtk (check name)</li>
<li>Electron -- this would be a pretty fun little desktop project for Electron if you're a web dev interested in learning how to use it. You could leverage your web skills while learning that.</li>
</ul>
<p>You could leverage a library to open up an archive and view the files or you could code that yourself using the language's standard library. There's lots of deep dives that could be done here.</p>
<h2 id="edge-cases"><a class="header" href="#edge-cases">Edge Cases</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Support PDFs since some comics and books are in PDF format</li>
<li>Make the UI be able to be changed in size while maintaining the original aspect ratio of the page</li>
<li>Browse mode that renders thumbnails of all of the pages for easy browsing</li>
<li>Displaying a prompt to open the next archive in the directory when the end of the current file is reached (i.e., read the next issue)</li>
<li>Single page view vs side-by-side spread view</li>
<li>Support reading right to left instead of left to right for comics like manga</li>
<li>Big stretch goal: library that manages comics that have been imported or that exist within a directory and keep track of those that have been read and those that haven't</li>

<p>Okay! Heads up here. This is obviously a risky one. I probably wouldn't release this as open source unless you're knowledgable and confident. Maybe keep this one closed source and be wary. Just because wow! There seems like there's some risk here with sensitive info.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not a security or crytopgraphic expert. So, like, wow! There's a lot to consider here and learn. But that's the point of these. </p>
<p>All right, enough caveats. Do and share your own risk!</p>
<p>But the gist of the idea is to build an app that can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate secure password of varying length and complexity</li>
<li>Keep track of generated passwords</li>
<li>Be able to associate a username, email, URL, etc. for the password</li>
<li>Encrypt all the stored info</li>
<li>Be able to decrypt to get the data for yourself to use</li>
</ul>
<p>What you'll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI for creating, managing, and viewing the generated passwords</li>
<li>Storing the data</li>
<li>Crytography with securely storing the data so others can't view the data</li>
</ul>

<p>Technologies for potential exploration:</p>
<ul>
<li>GTK for desktop building</li>
<li>Native desktop libraries for Windows and Mac</li>
<li>Electron could be good for this I think! Just to learn and experiment and leverage existing web knowledge</li>
</ul>
